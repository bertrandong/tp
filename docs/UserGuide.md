## Introduction

A warm welcome to all home bakers to our Strack.io User Guide! Strack.io is designed to cater to all your needs, be it creating your menu, recording of customer information, or even tracking of orders. Here, you will find all the necessary information you need to kickstart your Strack.io journey. Don't forget to **make snacks, keep track, and use Strack!**

## Overview

Strack.io is a **desktop app for home bakers to manage contacts of their customers, optimized for use via 
a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type
fast, Strack.io can get your customer and order management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar strackio.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Staging of orders: `stage`

You can move an order to the next stage, in the chain of the four stages defined by Strack.io, in order namely: 
`Under Preparation`, `Ready for Delivery`, `Sent for delivery` and `Received by customer`. 
However, you cannot go back to a previous stage.

Format: `stage o/ORDER`

![Before running stage command](images/StageCommandBefore.png)

* Running `stage o/1` once will move the order with `ORDER_ID` 1 to `Ready for Delivery`.

![Run stage command once](images/StageCommandOnce.png)

* Running `stage o/1` three or more times will move the order with `ORDER_ID` 1 to `Received by customer`.

![Run stage command three times](images/StageCommandTrice.png)

### Completing of orders: `complete`

* `ORDER_ID` can accept *multiple, unique* `ORDER_ID` to be marked as completed as shown in the example below.

Example:
![Before state for CompleteCommand](images/CompleteCommandBefore.png)
* `complete 1 2 3` will complete orders with `ORDER_ID`s of `1`, `2` and `3`.

![After state for CompleteCommand](images/CompleteCommandAfter.png)
* This would be collated in the csv file in this directory: `[JAR file location]/data/completedorders.csv`

![CSV state for CompleteCommand](images/CompleteCommandCSV.png)

### Cancelling of orders: `cancel`

You can remove an ongoing order in your address book. Orders removed using `cancel` will not be logged into
`completedorders.csv`.

Format: `cancel ORDER_ID`

![result for cancelling order](images/CancelOrder1.png)
![result for cancelling order](images/CancelOrder2.png)

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

You can clear all entries from Strack.io.

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:heavy_exclamation_mark: **Note:**
Clearing all orders and customer contacts from Strack.io will reset the ID of the next created order
</div>

### Exiting the program: `exit`

You can exit the program using a command.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

Strack.io data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Strack.io data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Strack.io will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause Strack.io to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside of the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Strack.io home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues and constraints

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **Constraint on number of customers, menu items and orders**: <= 1 billion, which should be sufficient for almost all homemade bakers. Our app might be unable to handle numbers larger than that.
3. **Some fields, such as names of customers**, are not wrapped in GUI. You can drag the window wider to see full text, which should be sufficient to accommodate almost all common names.
4. **Customer Names** can only contain alphanumeric characters. If the name involves slashes or special alphabets, you have to use an alternative, such as using double space in place of slash.
5. **Error Messages and suggestions** may not always be given in the most straight-forward way, often because slashes in commands may be interpreted in a few different ways. Refer to the user guide if you think error messages and suggestions shown in the app are unclear.
